## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Sayan (@sayan-geoDL)

ðŸŽ¯ I'm passionate about applying **AI and machine learning** to **geospatial systems**, with a focus on weather forecasting, climate analysis, and risk prediction.

### ðŸ‘€ Interests
- AI-driven models for geospatial and environmental data
- Weather and climate forecasting on short to medium timescales
- Risk modeling and predictive analytics
- Open-source GIS tools (especially QGIS)
- Building lightweight, efficient AI models for real-world applications

### ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
- Implementing advanced deep learning architectures (e.g., LSTMs, CNNs, transformers) for spatiotemporal data
- Working with weather station datasets, remote sensing data, and reanalysis products
- Integrating geospatial data pipelines with AI workflows
### ðŸŽ“ Academic Background

I hold a BSc. degree in Physics from University of Calcutta (2013). A Masters degree in Physics from Banaras Hindu University (2016) and currently pursuing a PhD. Degree from Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (CAOS) of Indian Institute of Scienc,
Bangalore  
My present academic work focuses on finding impacts of decadal scale atmospheric modes on local weather extremes.
