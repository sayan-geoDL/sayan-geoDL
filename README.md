## 👋 Hi, I'm **Sayan Jana** (@sayan-geoDL)

🌍 I combine **AI, physics, and geospatial data** to build forecasting and risk models with real-world impact — especially in climate-sensitive sectors like insurance and reinsurance.  

---

### 🎯 What I Do

- Develop scalable ML pipelines for weather and climate forecasting (daily & sub-daily)  
- Design hybrid physical + data-driven loss functions to ensure forecasts respect real-world constraints  
- Build models that matter for risk: flood, basin rainfall response, climate extremes  
- Work with station data, reanalysis, remote sensing, and hydrometeorological inputs  
- Enable reproducibility & explainability: modular code, transparent preprocessing, validation, and deployment

### ⚙️ Key Projects

| Repo | Purpose | Highlights |
|------|---------|------------|
| **large-basin-ann-rain-response-pipeline** | Annual rainfall response modeling for large basins | Focus on hydrological risk modeling; data-driven + physics-aware approach |
| **lstm-weather-pipeline** | Station-level weather forecasting using LSTMs | Smart gap-filling, physics-aware loss functions, ensemble & CV support |
| **physaware-lstm-forecast** | Enhanced version with physical consistency (temperature, dew point, RH etc.) and robust scaling | Designed for applications in insurance / climate risk prediction |

### 🧰 Skills & Tools

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Processing**: Climatology-based gap filling, interpolation, feature scaling, time-series aggregation  
- **Modeling**: LSTM, ensemble methods, loss function engineering  
- **Domain Knowledge**: Meteorology, hydrology, climate extremes, basin rainfall response  
- **Reproducibility & Collaboration**: Modular architecture, clear documentation, validation reports

### 🎓 Academic Background

- **Ph.D. Candidate** — Centre for Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences (CAOS), IISc, Bangalore  
  Research: Decadal atmospheric modes & their influence on local weather extremes  
- **M.Sc. Physics** — Banaras Hindu University (2016)  
- **B.Sc. Physics** — University of Calcutta (2013)

### 🏛️ Value to Insurance & Reinsurance

- Forecasting climate extremes & basin rainfall with explainable models helps underwriters quantify risk more precisely  
- Transparent pipelines enable auditability & regulatory compliance (important for climate risk disclosure)  
- Ensemble modeling + physical consistency helps with worst-case scenarios & tail risk — very relevant for catastrophe funds, reinsurance treaties

Thank you for visiting!  
⌨️ I believe climate risk models must be as robust, transparent, and physically grounded as they are predictive. If you share that view — let’s connect.
